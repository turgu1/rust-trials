This is my trials at investigating the Rust language, using the EPUB-Inkplate code as a mean to evaluate how a complex program can be transform / translated to a pure Rust version.

Nothing fancy here, at least for now...

- [x] Using fltk-rs for UI rendering on a Linux platform
- [x] fontdue crate for fonts rendition
- [x] My own Observer pattern generic struct for callback functions
- [x] My own LowUi abstraction trait to separate the app from the harware specific issues
